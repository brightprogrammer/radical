# radical bootloader
##### A simple bootloader project that I make while learning systems programming  

Well, the heading is quite self explanatory. Name of [repository](https://github.com/brightprogrammer/radical) is radical as it is a beginners project and can be quite unstable ( and fast ðŸ™ƒ ).

---
### motivation : 
I am learning/working on this
- because I just want to
- cebause(ðŸ™ƒ) I want to learn from ground up as it makes me high (get it? ðŸ˜œ)
- as this will be a foundation towards kernel development and then to a whole os

---

### goal :
The main goal is 
- not to develop something like grub, limine
- to take it as far as possible and explore more
- be The Lord Of The Rings (rings of assembly ðŸ˜œ)
- keep the code highly commented for future ref  

and that's it!

### resources :
- [BrokenThorn Entertainment](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html)
is an awesome resource resource to get started into systems programming. It is quite old, from the era of nokia 3310 in India, hence it is not that useful in modern world but is quite useful for beginner terms as you don't have to jump through wiki links/references and everything is presented to you on plate (i.e if you have some basic knowledge of assembly).  

- [Writing A Simple OS From Scratch [pdf]](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) same as broken thorn, it goes through basics.

More resoures might be added in future as I update this repo as I learn.
